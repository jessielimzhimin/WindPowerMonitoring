# ðŸ’¨Wind Power Smart MonitorðŸ’¨

## Project Background

As technology continue to advance, IoT technology has offered many solutions to human such as allowing human to collecting and monitoring data remotely. There are many platform for us to carry out IoT data analytic project as well to learn about the concept of IoT technology. <br />

In this IoT analytic project, we were given chance to apply the IoT technology on Wind Renewable Energy using ThingSpeak. Therefore, we decided to build an IoT based application named Wind Power Smart Monitor. Our Wind Power Smart Monitor has the following features: 
- Data Collection
- Data Visualization
 
***MATLAB Programming is used in this project***

## Objective of This Project

- To design a Wind Data Analytics Application using Internet of Things (IoT). <br />
- To design an interface in presenting Wind Power Data. <br />
- To discuss about the purpose and application of IoT data analytic in Wind Energy.<br />
- To perform data analysis and visualization using ThingSpeak as the IoT analytics platform. <br />
